This is a project containing source code to a maze-solving algortihm using a left/right hand rule in a maze generated by numbers 1-7 representing a wall in a triangular cell.
The code has some memleaks, its not perfect, but it does the job.
There are also two tests and a few mazes for personal interpretation.
